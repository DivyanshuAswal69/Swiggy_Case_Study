# Swiggy_Case_Study
Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive SQL case study analysis performed using advanced SQL techniques. The analysis leverages subqueries, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, and various aggregate functions to derive meaningful insights from the dataset.

SQL Techniques Utilized
Subqueries
Subqueries were employed to filter and aggregate data within larger queries, enhancing the efficiency and specificity of the analysis.

Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
CTEs were used to simplify complex queries and improve readability, especially for sequential and hierarchical data operations.

Window Functions
Window functions were utilized to perform calculations across a set of table rows that are related to the current row, enabling advanced analytical operations.

Aggregate Functions
Aggregate functions such as SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX were applied to compute summary statistics, providing a high-level overview of key metrics.
